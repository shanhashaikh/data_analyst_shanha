**Project Title:**     
Profiling and Diagnostic Analysis of the Student List Dataset

**Project Description:**    
Diagnostic Analysis of Student Dataset Profiling Results
This analysis focuses on diagnosing the quality, completeness, and structure of the student list dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and potential issues that may affect downstream processes like data visualization or machine learning.
Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to:
1.	Perform a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of the student list dataset using profiling techniques.
2.	Identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and data type mismatches.
3.	Provide insights and recommendations for improving the dataset quality.

In any data-driven project, understanding the data is a critical first step. Poor-quality data can adversely impact analysis results and decision-making processes. The student list dataset profiling was conducted to:
•	Assess the dataset's overall structure.
•	Identify potential problems such as missing or invalid entries.
•	Prepare the dataset for further processing or reporting.

Dataset: The Student_List dataset highlights diverse academic backgrounds, work experience levels, and global representation.
•	Student_ID: Unique identifier for each student.
•	Name: Student's name.
•	Age: Ranges from 22 to 35 years.
•	Gender: Male or Female.
•	GPA: Ranges from 2.55 to 4.0.
•	Work_Experience_Years: Ranges from 0 to 10 years.
•	Specialization: Fields of study (HR, Finance, Marketing, IT, Operations).
•	Country: Diverse, including India, USA, UK, China, Germany, Canada.
•	Admission_Year: Mainly 2021 to 2023.
•	Graduation_Status: Ongoing or Completed.

Methodology:
•  Data Ingestion:
•	Upload raw dataset to an AWS S3 bucket for secure and scalable storage.

•  Data Profiling:
•	Conducted data profiling process using AWS Glue DataBrew
•	Captured and analyzed key statistics like missing values, duplicates, unique entries, and outliers.

Data Profiling Overview
 
Note.  Primary Source.

Data Profiling results in Transform bucket Note.  Primary Source.

Data Diagnostic Steps:
•	Missing data analysis to identify columns with null or incomplete entries.
•	Detection of duplicates and redundant records.
•	Examination of data types for column consistency.
•	Outlier detection for numerical fields, if applicable.

Documentation and Reporting:
•	Summarized observations from profiling screenshots.
•	Provided actionable recommendations for addressing identified issues.

Tools and Technologies:
•  AWS S3 for data storage and organization.
•  AWS Glue and DataBrew for data profiling.

Deliverables:
•  Profiling Results: Detailed screenshots showcasing dataset profiling outcomes (e.g., missing values, duplicate analysis, data types).
•  Diagnostic Analysis Report:
Identification of data quality issues.
Detailed observations and interpretation of the profiling results.
•  Recommendations for Data Improvement: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for further processing.


Timeline for AWS Implementation:
•	Day 1-2: Dataset collection and profiling.
•	Day 3-4: Analysis of Profiling results.
•	Day 5: Documentation and reporting.
•	Day 6: Final Recommendations

Diagnostic Analysis Based on Profiling Results
From the screenshots of the profiling results, the following observations were made:
1.	Missing Values:
o	Certain columns (e.g., names, grades) have a percentage of missing or null entries.
o	Missing data could lead to incomplete analysis or inaccurate insights if not addressed.
2.	Duplicates:
o	Duplicate entries were detected in the student IDs or names column, indicating redundancy in records.
o	Action Required: Remove duplicates to maintain data integrity.
3.	Data Types:
o	Some columns show mismatched or inconsistent data types (e.g., numeric fields stored as text).
o	Action Required: Standardize column data types for accuracy in computation.
4.	Unique Values:
o	Specific columns, such as Student IDs, are expected to be unique. Profiling results indicate some issues with non-unique values.
5.	Data Distribution and Outliers:
o	Numerical fields were checked for outliers. Screenshots indicate potential inconsistencies or invalid entries (e.g., negative grades or unrealistic values).


Key Recommendations
1.	Handle Missing Data:
o	Use imputation methods (mean, median, mode) or remove rows with excessive null values.
2.	Remove Duplicates:
o	Eliminate redundant records to maintain accuracy in the dataset.
3.	Standardize Data Types:
o	Convert inconsistent data types into a standard format suitable for analysis (e.g., ensure numeric fields are stored as integers or floats).
4.	Outlier Treatment:
o	Validate numerical fields and correct or remove invalid entries.
5.	Data Validation:
o	Implement validation rules to ensure Student IDs and other critical fields remain unique and error-free.

This completes the Diagnostic Analysis for the student list dataset.
